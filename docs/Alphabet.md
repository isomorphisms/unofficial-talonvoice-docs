# Alphabet

Talon, like most speech-to-text programs, can't tell the difference between homophones. It can't tell the difference between `ğŸ”Š there`, `ğŸ”Š their`, and `ğŸ”Š they're`, for example. The problem is similar for the pronounciation of letters, such as how `ğŸ”Š tea` and `ğŸ”Š T` sound the same.

Furthermore, hearing engines like Dragon expect sentences, not letters, so you must develop a workaround to spell things. To solve this, Talon defines keywords to stand for individual letters. You must memorize these letter-codes to use Talon well.

As of April 2018, the standard alphabet letter-words was as follows. Most other [Rules](Rules.md) can be learned through repetition and their association with their Voice Command's meaning. These words, however, were chosen to ensure a unique sound to allow for easier and more accurate detection.
